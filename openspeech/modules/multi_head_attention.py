class MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):
    r"""
    Multi-Head Attention proposed in "Attention Is All You Need"
    Instead of performing a single attention function with d_model-dimensional keys, values, and queries,
    project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned linear projections to d_head dimensions.
    These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values.
    Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation
    subspaces at different positions.

    MultiHead(Q, K, V) = Concat(head_1, ..., head_h) 路 W_o
        where head_i = Attention(Q 路 W_q, K 路 W_k, V 路 W_v)

    Args:
        dim (int): The dimension of model (default: 512)
        num_heads (int): The number of attention heads. (default: 8)

    Inputs: query, key, value, mask
        - **query** (batch, q_len, d_model): tensor containing projection vector for decoders.
        - **key** (batch, k_len, d_model): tensor containing projection vector for encoders.
        - **value** (batch, v_len, d_model): tensor containing features of the encoded input sequence.
        - **mask** (-): tensor containing indices to be masked

    Returns: output, attn
        - **output** (batch, output_len, dimensions): tensor containing the attended output features.
        - **attn** (batch * num_heads, v_len): tensor containing the attention (alignment) from the encoders outputs.
